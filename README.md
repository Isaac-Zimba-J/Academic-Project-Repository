Project structure
Your project architecture consists of three main components:

1. **Shared Project**:
   - **Type**: Console Application
   - **Purpose**: Contains shared logic, models, and services that are used by both the client and server projects. This promotes code reusability and consistency across the application.
   - **Benefits**: 
     - Avoids code duplication.
     - Ensures consistency in logic and data models.
     - Simplifies maintenance and updates.

2. **Server Project**:
   - **Type**: Web API
   - **Purpose**: Handles backend operations, including data processing, business logic, and communication with the database. It references the shared project to utilize common models and services.
   - **Benefits**:
     - Clear separation of backend logic.
     - Utilizes shared resources to maintain consistency.

3. **Client Project**:
   - **Type**: Blazor Standalone App
   - **Purpose**: Manages the frontend user interface and client-side logic. It references the shared project to use common models and services, ensuring the frontend and backend are in sync.
   - **Benefits**:
     - Clear separation of frontend logic.
     - Utilizes shared resources to maintain consistency.

**Overall Benefits**:
- **Code Reusability**: Shared logic and models prevent code duplication.
- **Consistency**: Ensures both client and server use the same definitions and logic.
- **Maintainability**: Easier to update and maintain shared code.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Modular structure makes the codebase easier to understand.
- **Testing**: Shared logic can be tested independently.
- **Scalability**: Easier to scale and extend the application.
- **Development Efficiency**: Parallel development on different parts of the application.
